# writing an equation on find the perfect roots
# showing solution
xx = 1**2
x = 1
y = 6/2
emmanuel = (xx - x - y)
print("the solution:",emmanuel)
# converting a float too an integral
print(type(emmanuel))
print(int(emmanuel))
# so there for question x**2 - x - 6 ...
# the first perfect root gotten is -3
# to find the perfect square
y = 6 / -3
emmanuel = (xx - x - y)
print(emmanuel)
print(int(emmanuel))
# so there for the perfect square of -6 are -3, 2
answer = (-3 * 2)
